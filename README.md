## What is the Open Page module?

Open Page is a free open source module for any FreePBXÂ® 17 based systems including TangoPBX and IncrediblePBX. It is published by TangoPBX LLC, and extends the feature set provided by the conventional Paging module. 

With Open Page, the PBX administrator can:
* specify recordings to automatically play before making a live overhead page
* set up paging groups to one or more multicast addresses
* schedule recurring pages
* configure pages to use valet mode where the audio is first recorded in full by the paging party and then the recording is played to the page group.

## Module License

The Open Page module is published under GNU AGPL 3.0

## Module Requirements

Open Page requires FreePBX, IncrediblePBX or TangoPBX 17, it will not work on older versions. It also has installation prerequisites: the open source Paging and Recording modules.
