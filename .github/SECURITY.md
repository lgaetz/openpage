# Security Policy for TangoPBX

## Our Commitment

The TangoPBX team takes the security of our software seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are committed to addressing security issues responsibly and in a timely manner.

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report sensitive security issues privately by:

1.  **Using GitHub Security Advisories:** Whenever possible, please report vulnerabilities using the private vulnerability reporting feature provided by GitHub. This is the preferred method.
2.  **Emailing:** If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, send an email to `security[at]tangopbx[dot]org`. Please use a clear subject line, such as "Security Vulnerability Report for TangoPBX [MODULE]".

**What to include in your report:**

* A clear description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
* The affected version(s) of TangoPBX.
* Any potential impact of the vulnerability.
* Your contact information (optional, but helpful).

We will strive to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within [e.g., 48 hours] and provide a timeline for addressing the issue.
